## Highlights

We present **CartiMorph**, a framework for automated knee articular cartilage morphometrics. It includes:

*   A method for automated **cartilage thickness mapping** that is robust to cartilage lesions.
*   A method for automated **full-thickness cartilage loss (FCL)** estimation.
*   A rule-based **cartilage parcellation** method that is robust to FCL.
